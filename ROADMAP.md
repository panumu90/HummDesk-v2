## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**AI API Costs:**
- **Risk:** Claude API costs scale with usage
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement caching for common queries

- **Mitigation:**
  - Database partitioning by account_id
  - Read replicas for analytics
  - Query optimization and indexing

**Real-Time Performance:**
- **Risk:** WebSocket connections overwhelm server
- **Mitigation:**
  - Horizontal scaling with Redis pub/sub

  - Faster iteration cycle
  - Community-driven innovation

**Market Timing:**
- **Risk:** BPO companies slow to adopt AI
- **Mitigation:**
